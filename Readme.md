## BOB - the bot
Hi, I am BOB! I am a chatbot built on messenger designed for College students, and teachers to help them get access to important information instantly.
I am currently available only on messenger.
[try me!](m.me/ChatBotBOB)

## Motivation
I give the college community instant access to necessary information regarding the campus, academics and its activities. This will save them precious time wasted while waiting for a response from others via existing groups on Whatsapp/Messenger.
